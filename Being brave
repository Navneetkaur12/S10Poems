One night , at about 2 or 3 in the clock I saw an elephant with its gleaming tusk who came after me . His tusk was waving like the stream of a jet and he was about to eat me but I didn’t scream because I didn’t want him to see that I was afraid of him. Then , an idea came into my mind that I will escape from that place and crawl in bed with dad
Once upon a  time there was a terrible giant who had three heads , 20 arms with red hands and a hot fire came from his mouth , chasing after me and he announced that he would grind my bones to make them into bread . but for him , i was too smart as i fooled him because i crawled in bed with dad before his hand could touch me.
I am not afraid of anything that bothers me at night. Once I was caught by forty ghosts all white and sparkling  and I just ran them around the room. They think maybe I need to rest a little while they can hold me . Then when they jumped on my bed they went crazy knowing that I had slipped and crawled on the bed with dad.
No giants, ghosts or elephants have dared to come in there
'Coz if they did he'd beat 'em up and chase 'em to their lair.
They just hang 'round the children's rooms
an' snap an' snarl an' bite
An' laugh if they can make 'em yell
for help with all their might.
But I don't ever yell out loud. I'm not that sort of lad,
I slip from out the covers and I crawl in bed with dad.
