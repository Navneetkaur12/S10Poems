One night , at about 2 or 3 in the clock I saw an elephant with its gleaming tusk who came after me . His tusk was waving like the stream of a jet and he was about to eat me but I didn’t scream because I didn’t want him to see that I was afraid of him. Then , an idea came into my mind that I will escape from that place and crawl in bed with dad
Once upon a  time there was a terrible giant who had three heads , 20 arms with red hands and a hot fire came from his mouth , chasing after me and he announced that he would grind my bones to make them into bread . but for him , i was too smart as i fooled him because i crawled in bed with dad before his hand could touch me.
